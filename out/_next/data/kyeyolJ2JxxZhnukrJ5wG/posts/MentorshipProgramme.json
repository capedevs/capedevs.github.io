{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe [Mentor List](https://www.developermentoring.guide/finding-a-mentor/mentor-list?ref=capesoftwarecommunity.co.za) is a community-driven effort built on top of [\"The Ultimate Developer Mentoring Guide\"](https://www.developermentoring.guide/?ref=capesoftwarecommuntiy.co.za) that connects those seeking mentorship with willing mentors.

Many of the mentors hang out in the [ZATech](https://zatech.co.za/?ref=capesoftwarecommunity.co.za) Slack #mentoring channel.\n\nAre you keen for mentorship?
